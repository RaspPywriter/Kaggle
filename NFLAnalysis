# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

These questions came from the Washignton Post, so I'll start with them: Which stadiums had the most arrests? The least? Are arrests more likely when the home team lost a game? Does the score correlate with number of arrests? (For example, if the game ended in a narrow loss for the home team, does this correlate with more arrests?) Are there any stadiums with consistent arrest rates, regardless of how the game ended?

Some questions I have On certain days (Thursday vs Sunday vs Monday) Did the arrest rates change year to year?
"""
#To start the analysis, I'm going to import the data

arrestsTotal = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-arrests/arrests.csv')
notes = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-arrests/notes.csv')

#Now start by doing basic data analysis to learn more about the data sets, I like to see the first 5 rows, last 5 rows, and a random sample **This way I know what the data looks like.

arrestsTotal.head()

#Get the data shape
arrestsTotal.shape

#Notes dataset, these are just extra information about the dataset.
notes.head()

#Get the last 5 rows
arrestsTotal.tail()
